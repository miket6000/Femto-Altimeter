Femto-Altimeter
================
The Femto-Altimeter is my attempt to create the smallest possible altimeter for model rocketry with the following features:
- Bluetooth LE connection to a phone to arm, check continuity and configure.
- Capable of electronic deployment.
- Altitude logging.
- Run off a single cell lithium battery, with external capacitor for deployment (if necessary).
- Be as small as possible while avoiding High Density Interconnect (uvia, etc) to allow lower cost construction.
- Designed to use parts avaialble in stock at JLCPCB at the time of design.

The resulting Femto is approximately 10x18mm (smaller than 1/2"x3/4") excluding battery. Weight will be determined when first samples arrive, but it's expected to be less than 2g.
